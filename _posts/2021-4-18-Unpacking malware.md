# sample 
WE can donload the sample from [here](https://app.any.run/tasks/56248422-b327-4226-8a79-3155e24b999d/)
# Tools
1. Exeinfo PE
2. pestudio
3. Detect it Easy (DiE)
 
# Packed Indentify 
In this section, I will learn how to identify packed malware, so I will load the sample in ```Exeinfo PE``` tool and see the results.

1. we see that the sample does something with ```upx```
2. [UPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX) (Ultimate Packer for Executables) is an open source executable packer supporting a number of file formats from different operating systems

In this time I will load the sample in ```pestudio```, which amazing tool that used by malware analyst in static analysis,it has many options that help malware analyst to do initial
analysis well, when we open sample in ```pestudio``` we see in main window the property ```signature``` with the ```UPX``` and this is another indicator, this indicator tells us that a sample do something
with ```UPX```
