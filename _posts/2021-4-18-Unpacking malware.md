# Introducation

I am happy to write about unpacking malware, unpacking malware is very important concept that any malware analyst must deal with it to extract the malicious code from packed
malware, performs his analysis and in this article I will discuss in unpacking malware with many tools to deal with a lot of tools in analysis packed malware.

# sample 
WE can donload the sample from [here](https://app.any.run/tasks/56248422-b327-4226-8a79-3155e24b999d/)
# Tools
1. Exeinfo PE
2. pestudio
3. Detect it Easy (DiE)
 
# Packed Indentify 
In this section, I will learn how to identify packed malware, so I will load the sample in ```Exeinfo PE``` tool and see the results.

1. we see that the sample does something with ```upx```
2. [UPX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UPX) (Ultimate Packer for Executables) is an open source executable packer supporting a number of file formats from different operating systems

In this time I will load the sample in ```pestudio```, which amazing tool that used by malware analyst in static analysis,it has many options that help malware analyst to do initial
analysis well, when we open sample in ```pestudio``` we see in main window the property ```signature``` with the ```UPX``` and this is another indicator, this indicator tells us that a sample do something
with ```UPX```

In the last tool which called Detect it Easy (DiE), I will load a sample in it and we can see the results.

1. the sample is being using the packer which ```UPX```
2. the compiler is called ```Borland Delphi```
3. the linker is called ```Turbo linker```

If you click in this button  ```>```, You will get the same previous details

now you can click close in order to back main window, click on ```Signatures``` to show the  ```signature``` that used by ```DiE``` to detect that the sample is packed with ```UPX```.
