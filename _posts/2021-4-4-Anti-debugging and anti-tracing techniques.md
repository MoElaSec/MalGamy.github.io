1--> Malware authors use Anti-Reverse Engineering Techniques a lot to impede the reverse engineering process of the malware and malware analyst runs malware samples in debugger to analyze the functionality and behavoir.

2--> the malware sample plays a lot of tricks to recognizes the dubuggers that are running with the help of Anti-reverse engineering techniques, when malware recognizes the dubuggers ,it hide the malicious functionality or it may terminate.

3--> I will presents several anti-debugging techniques that used on windows NT-base operationg systems.Anti-debugging techniques are ways for a program to detected if it runs under control of a debugger.they are used by commercial executable protector,packers and malicious software to prevent or is slow-down the process of reverse-engineering.

### Description 

[IsDebuggerPresent()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-isdebuggerpresent), the most widely used anti-debugging method in Windows. However, here we will go a little bit into what isDebuggerPresent() does internally. As we can read in Microsoftâ€™s documentation, it comes with a very simple prototype from Kernel32 library.

### Syntax

```BOOL IsDebuggerPresent();
```
### Return value
IsDebuggerPresent returns 1 if the process is being debugged or returns 0 if the process is not being debugged . This API simply reads the PEB!BeingDebugged byte-flag (located at offset 2 in the PEB structure Circumventing it is as easy as setting PEB!BeingDebugged to 0.
