Malware authors use Anti-Reverse Engineering Techniques alot to impede the reverse engineering process of the malware .the malware analyst runs malware samples in debugger to analyze the functionality and behavoir.the malware samples plays a lot of tricks to recognizes the dubuggers that are running with the help of Anti-reverse engineeringtechniques.when malware recognizes the dubuggers ,it hide the malicious functionality ot it may terminate.

I will presents several anti-debugging techniques that used on windows NT-base operationg systems.Anti-debugging techniques are ways for a program to detected if it runs under control of a debugger.they are used by commercial executable protector,packers and malicious software to prevent or is slow-down the process of reverse-engineering.

## IsDebuggerPresent

### Description 

[IsDebuggerPresent()](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/debugapi/nf-debugapi-isdebuggerpresent), the most widely used anti-debugging method in Windows. However, here we will go a little bit into what isDebuggerPresent() does internally. As we can read in Microsoftâ€™s documentation, it comes with a very simple prototype from Kernel32 library.

### Syntax

```BOOL IsDebuggerPresent();
```
### Return value
IsDebuggerPresent returns 1 if the process is being debugged, 0 otherwise. This API simply reads the PEB!BeingDebugged byte-flag (located at offset 2 in the PEB structure Circumventing it is as easy as setting PEB!BeingDebugged to 0.
### EXample
